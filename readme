# manage keys with ansible

it manages authorized_keys in a different directory, root owned (so the user can't add and remove keys), and uses a template
and then all you need to do is add/remove keys from defaults/main.yml, and it'll do the magic for you
unfortunately the authorized_keys module isn't good with removals
so after you get it setup... you'd just have to add users to defaults/main.yml... ie: key1  and then add key1.pub into files/
